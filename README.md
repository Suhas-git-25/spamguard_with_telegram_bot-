## 🧩 Tech Stack

* **React** — UI for interactive frontend
* **TypeScript** — Typed JavaScript
* **Vite** — Fast bundler and dev server
* **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling
* **shadcn-ui** — UI component library

## ✨ Key Features & Functionalities

Here’s what this application can do:

1. **Phone Number Spam Detection**

   * Input a phone number, and the system will analyze whether it’s likely used for spam, scams, or fraudulent activity.

2. **Message Content Analysis**

   * Paste in a text message or SMS content. The AI model will classify whether it contains spam indicators or suspicious content.

3. **AI-Powered Prediction**

   * Uses machine learning or a pre-trained model to assess risk scores based on features, keywords, or patterns.

4. **Instant Feedback & UI Response**

   * Get immediate visual feedback (e.g. “Safe” / “Risky” / “Spam”) with possible explanations or confidence levels.

5. **Responsive Interface**

   * Clean, modern design that works well on mobile and desktop screens.

6. **Extensible & Customizable**

   * You can expand detection logic, add more languages or rules, or link to backend APIs for more depth.

## 🧠 How It Works (Internal Logic — Optional Section)

Below is a high-level outline of how the spam check functionality might be implemented (you can adjust to your actual logic):

* **Preprocessing**: Clean the phone number or message text (remove punctuation, normalize text)
* **Feature Extraction**:

  * Numeric patterns (repeated digits, country codes, length)
  * Keyword presence (e.g. “free”, “win”, “urgent”)
  * Context tokens (e.g. links, “click here”)
* **Model Inference / Rule Engine**: Use a pre-trained classification model (e.g. logistic regression, transformer, or custom rules)
* **Scoring & Thresholding**: Classify the input as “Safe”, “Possibly Spam”, or “Spam” based on the score
* **UI Feedback**: Show result, confidence, and maybe suggestions (“avoid replying”, “verify number”, etc.)
